        <h2>A Career in Film and Technology</h2>
        <p>Before diving into the world of technology, I spent years working on film sets, learning the art of storytelling, and collaborating with talented creatives. My background as a theatre major fostered my love for production and gave me a deep appreciation for the power of creative collaboration.</p>

        <p>Even today, those experiences influence my work in tech. I approach every project with the same attention to detail and passion for innovation that I learned on set. Now, when I'm not immersed in tech, you can find me hiking with my husband and our charcoal Labrador, often exploring the scenic beauty of Malibu Beach.</p>
        <img src="/malibu-beach.png" alt="Malibu Beach" class="malibu-image">

        <h2>Passion for Customer Success</h2>
        <p>My passion lies in helping clients achieve their goals. I thrive on building relationships with customers, understanding their needs, and driving success through collaboration and innovative solutions. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working closely with amazing clients, ensuring they get the most value out of the products and services they use.</p>

        <p>Customer success, for me, is more than just support—it's about truly partnering with clients to ensure they are set up for success and reaching their full potential. This requires ongoing communication, training, and strategic planning. I love seeing the positive impact our solutions can have on a client’s business, and I take pride in being a part of that journey.</p>

        <h2>Becoming More Technical</h2>
        <p>In my role, I’m constantly looking to enhance my technical knowledge to better support my customers. By working closely with our <span class="highlight">solutions architect</span> and <span class="highlight">product teams</span>, I’m learning the inner workings of our platform and solutions so I can provide deeper insights and technical support. I enjoy diving into the technical side of things, from understanding product architecture to exploring how integrations work, and I look forward to continuing to expand this knowledge.</p>

        <p>This desire to become more technical comes from my commitment to providing the best possible support to my customers. I believe that having a strong technical foundation allows me to better anticipate challenges and offer proactive solutions. My goal is to bridge the gap between technical complexity and customer success, ensuring that clients feel confident and empowered in using our products.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Movies</h2>
        <p>I have a deep appreciation for films that blend creativity, mystery, and style—films that surprise you and make you think. Some of my favorite movies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beetlejuice</strong> – A quirky, offbeat masterpiece that inspires me to embrace my weird and creative side.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Indemnity</strong> – A timeless noir that has an edge of danger and elegance.</li>
            <li><strong>Sabrina</strong> – A perfect balance of charm and style, led by the unforgettable Audrey Hepburn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Family and Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Family is the foundation of everything I do. I’m incredibly close to my sister, whom I affectionately call "Peanut." Her strength and determination inspire me daily, especially now that she’s qualified for the Boston Marathon. Her success reminds me to keep pushing forward and chasing my own goals.</p>
