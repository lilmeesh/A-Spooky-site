    <h1>I put a spell on you and now you're mine</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>A Career in Film and Technology</h2>
        <p>Before diving into the world of technology, I spent years working on film sets, learning the art of storytelling, and collaborating with talented creatives. My background as a theatre major fostered my love for production and gave me a deep appreciation for the power of creative collaboration.</p>

        <p>Even today, those experiences influence my work in tech. I approach every project with the same attention to detail and passion for innovation that I learned on set.</p>

        <h2>Passion for Customer Success</h2>
        <p>My passion lies in helping clients achieve their goals. I thrive on building relationships with customers, understanding their needs, and driving success through collaboration and innovative solutions. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working closely with amazing clients, ensuring they get the most value out of the products and services they use.</p>

        <p>Customer success, for me, is more than just support—it's about truly partnering with clients to ensure they are set up for success and reaching their full potential. This requires ongoing communication, training, and strategic planning. I love seeing the positive impact our solutions can have on a client’s business, and I take pride in being a part of that journey.</p>

        <h2 class="favorite-movies">Favorite Movies</h2>
        <p>I have a deep appreciation for films that blend creativity, mystery, and style—films that surprise you and make you think. Some of my favorite movies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beetlejuice</strong> – A quirky, offbeat masterpiece that inspires me to embrace my weird and creative side.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Indemnity</strong> – A timeless noir that has an edge of danger and elegance.</li>
            <li><strong>Sabrina</strong> – A perfect balance of charm and style, led by the unforgettable Audrey Hepburn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Family and Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Family is the foundation of everything I do. I’m incredibly close to my sister, whom I affectionately call "Peanut." Her strength and determination inspire me daily, especially now that she’s qualified for the Boston Marathon. Her success reminds me to keep pushing forward and chasing my own goals.</p>
