    <h1>Michelle's Story</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>A Career in Film and Technology</h2>
        <p>Before diving into the world of technology, I spent years working on film sets, learning the art of storytelling, and collaborating with talented creatives. My background as a theatre major fostered my love for production and gave me a deep appreciation for the power of creative collaboration.</p>

        <p>Even today, those experiences influence my work in tech. I approach every project with the same attention to detail and passion for innovation that I learned on set. Now, when I'm not immersed in tech, you can find me hiking with my husband and our charcoal Labrador, often exploring the scenic beauty of Malibu Beach.</p>
        <img src="/malibu-beach.png" alt="Malibu Beach" class="malibu-image">

        <h2>Favorite Movies</h2>
        <p>I have a deep appreciation for films that blend creativity, mystery, and style—films that surprise you and make you think. Some of my favorite movies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beetlejuice</strong> – A quirky, offbeat masterpiece that inspires me to embrace my weird and creative side.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Indemnity</strong> – A timeless noir that has an edge of danger and elegance.</li>
            <li><strong>Sabrina</strong> – A perfect balance of charm and style, led by the unforgettable Audrey Hepburn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Family and Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Family is the foundation of everything I do. I’m incredibly close to my sister, whom I affectionately call "Peanut." Her strength and determination inspire me daily, especially now that she’s qualified for the Boston Marathon. Her success reminds me to keep pushing forward and chasing my own goals.</p>

        <h2>A Journey in Technology</h2>
        <p>My interest in technology grew when I started a podcast with a close friend. It was through this project that I discovered my passion for coding and the endless possibilities that come with building in the digital world. We’re excited to use <span class="highlight">Vercel</span> to launch new episodes of our podcast every week. I'm constantly eager to learn more, face new challenges, and continue building on this journey.</p>
