    <h1>Who is Meesh?</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Michelle, though most people know me as Meesh. I’m a tech enthusiast, a film lover, and someone who deeply values my time spent with family and in nature.</p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Before I found my way into the world of technology, I spent years working on film sets. The energy on set was something special, and my background as a theatre major made me feel right at home. It’s where my love for storytelling truly blossomed. I was surrounded by talented creatives, constantly learning, and though my journey took me to a different field, I still carry that creative spark in everything I do.</p>

        <p>When I'm not immersed in technology, you can often find me outdoors with my husband and our loyal charcoal Labrador, who adores hiking as much as we do. One of our favorite places to visit is Malibu Beach. There's something magical about watching the sun set over the water, and it gives us a chance to unplug from the digital world and connect with nature.</p>

        <!-- Malibu Beach Image -->

        <p>On the days we aren't hiking, I find comfort in films. Some of my all-time favorite movies include the quirky and dark *Beetlejuice*, the gripping classic *Double Indemnity*, and the ever-elegant *Sabrina* starring Audrey Hepburn. These films resonate with me in different ways, reminding me of the beauty of storytelling and the timeless impact of cinema.</p>

        <h2>My Sister, My Hero</h2>
        <p>Family is everything to me, and I'm especially close to my sister, who I affectionately call "Peanut." She's an incredible person and recently qualified for the Boston Marathon, a testament to her dedication and hard work. She's my inspiration, and our bond is one of the most important things in my life.</p>

        <h2>Passions and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Outside of tech and family, I have a few other passions. I’ve been playing the drums for years, and there's something about the rhythm and creativity of it that I love. Music, like coding, is a language, and it's one I’ve enjoyed learning.</p>

        <p>Speaking of coding, my passion for technology grew when I decided to start a podcast with a friend. We’ve been working on it consistently, and one of my goals is to use <span class="highlight">Vercel</span> to update our website every week with new episodes. I love a challenge, and technology constantly offers new ones. There’s nothing like the satisfaction of solving a complex problem, and Vercel makes achieving what sometimes seems impossible feel completely within reach.</p>
