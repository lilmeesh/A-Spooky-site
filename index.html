    <h1>Who is Meesh?</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Michelle, but most call me Meesh. I'm a tech enthusiast, film aficionado, and someone who treasures every moment with family and nature.</p>

        <h2>My Journey into Film and Beyond</h2>
        <p>Before I found my calling in technology, I lived and breathed the film industry. Working on film sets as a theatre major was an experience like no other. I thrived in the collaborative energy and creative flow that surrounded me. The world of film isn’t just a job—it’s a passion. Even though my career has taken me into tech, my love for storytelling and production still influences how I approach life and work today.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working, you'll probably find me hiking with my husband and our loyal charcoal Labrador. We love exploring the scenic trails around Los Angeles, especially the peaceful paths along Malibu Beach. Watching the sunset there, with the waves crashing in the background, has a way of calming the mind and inspiring creativity.</p>

        <h2>My Love for Cinema</h2>
        <p>Films have always been my escape and my inspiration. Some of my all-time favorites include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beetlejuice</strong> – This quirky and eccentric film has always held a special place in my heart. Its dark humor and creativity are unmatched.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Indemnity</strong> – A gripping noir classic. The suspense, the drama—it’s a film I can watch over and over again.</li>
            <li><strong>Sabrina</strong> – Audrey Hepburn’s charm in this film is timeless. It’s a movie filled with elegance, wit, and romance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Family and Inspirations</h2>
        <p>Family has always been a driving force in my life. I'm incredibly close to my sister, who I affectionately call "Peanut." She recently achieved an amazing milestone by qualifying for the Boston Marathon. Her dedication and perseverance inspire me every day, and I'm beyond proud of her!</p>

        <h2>Tech and My Podcast Journey</h2>
        <p>A few years ago, I decided to dive into the world of technology when my friend and I started a podcast. That’s when I discovered my love for coding. Our goal is to update our podcast’s website every week with new episodes, and using <span class="highlight">Vercel</span> makes that task a joy. It provides the tools I need to achieve the impossible with ease, and there’s nothing like overcoming challenges in the tech space.</p>
